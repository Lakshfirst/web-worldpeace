especially in personal relations. In similar way World peace is an ideal of freedom, 
peace, and happiness among and within all nations and/or people.It can be referred to as the state of people from all countries in the world 
living harmoniously with each other.It creates one international community that can concentrate on greater issues. When countries work together,
they benefit their citizens since they can freely move from one country to another for employment, education or tourism.
The world is a place of constant change and a large part of this change comes from the machine of war and the advance of
 technology.  Some of humankind’s greatest innovations have come from the need to defend the rights and freedom of different people. Armed forces
 are not only used in the protection of others, but are also applied in an effort to rule over or eliminate what is perceived as weaker or inferior races. 
 For centuries there has been conflict between tribes, countries and nations. If humankind continues to travel this path he/she will no longer be the controlling entity on this planet.
 In a famous quote Benjamin Franklin said “Even peace may be purchased at too high a price”. What this says is that any life lost in war is a price too high to pay.
When will it end, when will there finally be World peace? Many things will need to change in order to achieve this noble goal. The goal of world peace is a possibility and may even
 happen in the near future, as more countries find freedom, self-government and become part of the global community. A global community that not only serves itself but also aids in 
stabilizing the world community. All these things are only part of what it takes to secure global peace. </b></p>
