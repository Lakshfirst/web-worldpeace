<li style="margin:10px;">World peace leads to increased globalization. Globalization is the act where people from different countries are able to interact freely with each other in various aspects.</li>
<li style="margin:10px;">World peace also leads to the promotion of tourism. With peace, people are freer to tour any country of their choice without fear of violence.</li>
<li style="margin:10px;">World peace also contributes to cultural exchanges. People are able to interact freely with each other and they can learn different cultures from other people.</li>
<li style="margin:10px;">World peace also contributes to more developed economies. This is because people are able to carry out both domestic and foreign investments without fear of the risk of future violence.</li>
<li style="margin:10px;">World peace also contributes to the unification of people to fight unfair vices. People are able to speak with one voice to get rid of vices like racism, religious discrimination and gender inequality.</li>
<li style="margin:10px;">World peace also contributes to the reduction of wars. Warring countries or internal nation conflicts can be reduced if world peace existed. War is the main cause of human suffering in the world.</li>
<li style="margin:10px;">With world peace, you are also assured of increased freedom of people. People get more freedom whether they are from different religions, race or country. This promotes global cohesion.</li>
